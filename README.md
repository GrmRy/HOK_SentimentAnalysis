# Honor of Kings - Google Play Reviews Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Google Play reviews for the popular mobile game, **Honor of Kings**. The goal is to analyze user feedback to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and to identify key themes and topics in the reviews.

The project uses a combination of the **VADER sentiment analysis tool** and **machine learning models** to classify the sentiment of the reviews. The entire workflow, from data scraping to model evaluation and visualization, is documented in the `ModelDevelopment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Data Scraping**
  Scrapes a large number of reviews for *Honor of Kings* directly from the Google Play Store using the `google-play-scraper` library.

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
  Cleans and preprocesses the raw text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stop words to prepare it for analysis.

* **Sentiment Analysis with VADER**
  Uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to perform a baseline sentiment analysis.

* **Machine Learning Models**
  Trains and evaluates several machine learning models:

  * Multinomial Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  Uses `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters for the machine learning models.

* **Data Visualization**
  Creates visualizations including:

  * Count plots
  * Box plots
  * Word clouds

## üöÄ Future Improvements

* **Deployment**
  Deploy the trained model as a web application using Streamlit or Flask to allow for real-time sentiment analysis of new reviews.

* **In-Depth Analysis**
  Conduct deeper analysis to extract more granular insights (e.g., most common praises and complaints).

* **Expand Dataset**
  Scrape and analyze reviews from other platforms such as:

  * Apple App Store
  * Reddit
  * Twitter/X

* **More Advanced Models**
  Experiment with state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT or DistilBERT to improve classification performance.
